This was my first large JavaScript project with LighthouseLabs. The project allows a user to register an account / login. It uses bcrypt for password hashing and cookie-session for encrypted cookies. Users that create an account and login are able to shorten URLS of their choosing as well as deleting users specific shortened URLS or edit shortened URLS to redirect to a different site of their choosing. I got a stronger understanding of using get and post requests with express and rendering that information with EJS.

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.
